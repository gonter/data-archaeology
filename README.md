It happend again, someone gave me a couple of files with important data
in it.  That's about all the information I got, so I feel like one of
those archeologists who are called to the new motor way construction
site where they discovered bones or whatever and someone has to do
something about that, QUICKLY!  It seems, I'm not alone, or otherwise
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_archaeology would not exist...

Anyway, let's start with the latest one (1)...

Notes:
1: Data Archeology applies also to the the scripts that were used to
recover data in the first place.  I have no idea any more, what I wrote
earlier or if it might be useful for someone else.  If I come across
one of them, I'll try to make them accessible too.
